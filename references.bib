	Abstract = {Previous attempts have been made to address sleep disorders in women; however, significant knowledge gaps in research and a lack of awareness among the research community continue to exist. There is a great need for scientists and clinicians to consider sex and gender differences in their sleep research to account for the unique biology of women. To understand the role of sex differences in sleep and the state of women's sleep health research, the Society for Women's Health Research convened an interdisciplinary expert panel of well-established sleep researchers and clinicians for a roundtable meeting. Focused discussions on basic and clinical research along with a focus on specific challenges facing women with sleep-related problems and effective therapies led to the identification of knowledge gaps and the development of research-related recommendations. Additionally, sex differences in sleep disorders were noted and discussed in the context of underlying hormonal differences. Differences in sleep behavior and sleep disorders may not only be driven by biological factors but also by gender differences in the way women and men report symptoms. Progress has been made in identifying sex and gender differences in many areas of sleep, but major research gaps in the areas of epidemiology, sleep regulation, sleep quality, diagnosis, and treatment need to be addressed. Identifying the underlying nature of sex and gender differences in sleep research has potential to accelerate improved care for both men and women facilitating better diagnosis, treatment, and ultimately prevention of sleep disorders and related comorbid conditions.},

@article{redline_effects_2004,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polysomnography is used to assess sleep quality and to gauge the functional effect of sleep disorders. Few population-based data are available to estimate the variation in sleep architecture across the population and the extent to which sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), a common health condition, contributes to poor sleep independent of other factors. The objective of this study was to describe the population variability in sleep quality and to quantify the independent associations with SDB.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses were performed on data from 2685 participants, aged 37 to 92 years, in a community-based multicenter cohort study. Dependent measures included the percentage time in each sleep stage, the arousal index, and sleep efficiency. Independent measures were age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidity status, and the respiratory disturbance index.
RESULTS: Lighter sleep was found in men relative to women and in American Indians and blacks relative to other ethnic groups. Increasing age was associated with impaired sleep in men, with less consistent associations in women. Notably, women had, on average, 106\% more slow wave sleep. Sleep-disordered breathing was associated with poorer sleep; however, these associations were generally smaller than associations with sex, ethnicity, and age. Current smokers had lighter sleep than ex-smokers or never smokers. Obesity had little effect on sleep.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep architecture varies with sex, age, ethnicity, and SDB. Individual assessment of the effect of SDB on sleep quality needs to account for other host characteristics. Men, but not women, show evidence of poorer sleep with aging, suggesting important sex differences in sleep physiology.},

	Abstract = {The sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythmicity both contribute to brain function, but whether this contribution differs between men and women and how it varies across cognitive domains and subjective dimensions has not been established. We examined the circadian and sleep-wake-dependent regulation of cognition in 16 men and 18 women in a forced desynchrony protocol and quantified the separate contributions of circadian phase, prior sleep, and elapsed time awake on cognition and sleep. The largest circadian effects were observed for reported sleepiness, mood, and reported effort; the effects on working memory and temporal processing were smaller. Although these effects were seen in both men and women, there were quantitative differences. The amplitude of the circadian modulation was larger in women in 11 of 39 performance measures so that their performance was more impaired in the early morning hours. Principal components analysis of the performance measures yielded three factors, accuracy, effort, and speed, which reflect core performance characteristics in a range of cognitive tasks and therefore are likely to be important for everyday performance. The largest circadian modulation was observed for effort, whereas accuracy exhibited the largest sex difference in circadian modulation. The sex differences in the circadian modulation of cognition could not be explained by sex differences in the circadian amplitude of plasma melatonin and electroencephalographic slow-wave activity. These data establish the impact of circadian rhythmicity and sex on waking cognition and have implications for understanding the regulation of brain function, cognition, and affect in shift-work, jetlag, and aging.},

@article{cain_sex_2010,
	Abstract = {Studies of sex differences in the timing of human circadian rhythms have reported conflicting results. This may be because the studies conducted to date have not controlled for the masking effects of the rest activity cycle on the circadian rhythms being assessed. In the present analysis of data collected under controlled conditions, we examined sex differences in the timing of circadian rhythms while minimizing masking from behavioral and environmental factors using a constant routine (CR) protocol. All participants (28 women and 28 men paired by habitual wake time; age range, 18 30 years) maintained a regular self selected sleep wake schedule at home prior to the study. After 3 baseline days in the laboratory, participants began a CR. Women were found to have a significantly higher melatonin amplitude and lower temperature amplitude than men. While sleep timing was the same between the 2 groups, the timing of the circadian rhythms of core body temperature and pineal melatonin secretion was earlier relative to sleep time in women as compared to men. Sleep therefore occurred at a later biological time for women than men, despite being at the same clock time. Given that sleep propensity and structure vary with circadian phase and are impacted by circulating melatonin, these findings may have important implications for understanding sex differences in sleep timing and duration, diurnal preference, and the prevalence of sleep disorders such as insomnia.},

@article{mong_sleep_2011,
	Abstract = {While much is known about the mechanisms that underlie sleep and circadian rhythms, the investigation into sex differences and gonadal steroid modulation of sleep and biological rhythms is in its infancy. There is a growing recognition of sex disparities in sleep and rhythm disorders. Understanding how neuroendocrine mediators and sex differences influence sleep and biological rhythms is central to advancing our understanding of sleep-related disorders. While it is known that ovarian steroids affect circadian rhythms in rodents, the role of androgen is less understood. Surprising findings that androgens, acting via androgen receptors in the master "circadian clock" within the suprachiasmatic nucleus, modulate photic effects on activity in males point to novel mechanisms of circadian control. Work in aromatase-deficient mice suggests that some sex differences in photic responsiveness are independent of gonadal hormone effects during development. In parallel, aspects of sex differences in sleep are also reported to be independent of gonadal steroids and may involve sex chromosome complement. This a summary of recent work illustrating how sex differences and gonadal hormones influence sleep and circadian rhythms that was presented at a Mini-Symposium at the 2011 annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite remarkable achievements in ensuring health equity, racial/ethnic disparities in sleep still persist and are emerging as a major area of concern. Accumulating evidence has not yet been well characterized from a broad perspective. We conducted a scoping review of studies on sleep disparities by race/ethnicity to summarize characteristics of existing studies and identify evidence gaps.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases for studies of racial/ethnic disparities in sleep. Studies that met inclusion criteria were retrieved and organized in a data charting form by study design, sleep measuring methods, sleep features, and racial/ethnic comparisons.
RESULTS: One hundred sixteen studies were included in this review. Most studies focused on disparities between Whites and Blacks. Disproportionately fewer studies examined disparities for Hispanic, Asian, and other racial/ethnic groups. Self-reported sleep was most frequently used. Sleep duration, overall sleep quality, and sleep disordered breathing were frequently studied, whereas other features including sleep efficiency, latency, continuity, and architecture were understudied, particularly in racial minority groups in the US. Current study findings on racial/ethnic disparities in most of sleep features is mixed and inconclusive.
CONCLUSIONS: This review identified significant evidence gaps in racial/ethnic disparities research on sleep. Our results suggest a need for more studies examining diverse sleep features using standardized and robust measuring methods for more valid comparisons of sleep health in diverse race/ethnicity groups.},

@article{goldstein_sleep_2020,
	Abstract = {Purpose: Prior studies investigating the relationship between sleep and serious psychological distress (SPD) have lacked racial/ethnic diversity and generalizability. We investigated associations between sleep and SPD among a large, nationally representative, and racially/ethnically diverse sample of US adults.
Methods: We pooled cross-sectional data from the 2004 to 2017 National Health Interview Survey. Participants self-reported sleep duration and sleep disturbances (eg, trouble falling and staying asleep). SPD was defined as a Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) score ≥13. Adjusting for sociodemographic, health behavior, and clinical characteristics, we used Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of SPD for each sleep characteristic, overall and by race/ethnicity.
Results: Among 316,840 participants, the mean age $\pm$ standard error was 46.9 $\pm$ 0.1 years, 52\% were women, 75\% were non-Hispanic (NH)-White, 16\% NH-Black, and 9\% Hispanic/Latinx. The prevalence of SPD was 3.4\% for NH-Whites, 4.1\% for NH-Blacks, and 4.5\% for Hispanics/Latinxs. Participants with {\textless}7 hours versus 7-9 hours of sleep duration were more likely to have SPD, and the magnitude of the association was strongest among NH-Black participants (PRNH-Blacks=3.50 [95\% CI: 2.97-4.13], PR Hispanics/Latinx=2.95 [2.42-3.61], and PRNH-Whites=2.66 [2.44-2.89]). Positive associations between sleep disturbances and SPD were generally stronger among NH-Black and Hispanic/Latinx compared to NH-White adults.
Conclusion: Poor sleep health was positively associated with SPD, and the magnitude of the association was generally stronger among racial/ethnic minorities. Future investigations should prospectively focus on the determinants and health consequences of SPD attributable to objectively measured sleep across racial/ethnic groups.},

@article{eastman_blacks_2012,
	Abstract = {The length of the free-running period (τ) affects how an animal re-entrains after phase shifts of the light-dark (LD) cycle. Those with shorter periods adapt faster to phase advances than those with longer periods, whereas those with longer periods adapt faster to phase delays than those with shorter periods. The free-running period of humans, measured in temporal isolation units and in forced desychrony protocols in which the day length is set beyond the range of entrainment, varies from about 23.5 to 26 h, depending on the individual and the experimental conditions (e.g., temporal isolation vs. forced desychrony). We studied 94 subjects free-running through an ultradian LD cycle, which was a forced desychrony with a day length of 4 h (2.5 h awake in dim light, {\textasciitilde}35 lux, alternating with 1.5 h for sleep in darkness). Circadian phase assessments were conducted before (baseline) and after (final) three 24-h days of the ultradian LD cycle. During these assessments, saliva samples were collected every 30 min and subsequently analyzed for melatonin. The phase shift of the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) from baseline to final phase assessment gave the free-running period. The mean $\pm$ SD period was 24.31 $\pm$ .23 h and ranged from 23.7 to 24.9 h. Black subjects had a significantly shorter free-running period than Whites (24.18 $\pm$ .23 h, N =20 vs. 24.37 $\pm$ .22 h, N = 55). We had a greater proportion of women than men in our Black sample, so to check the τ difference we compared the Black women to White women. Again, Black subjects had a significantly shorter free-running period (24.18 $\pm$ .23, N = 17 vs. 24.41 $\pm$ .23, N = 23). We did not find any sex differences in the free-running period. These findings give rise to several testable predictions: on average, Blacks should adapt quicker to eastward flights across time zones than Whites, whereas Whites should adjust quicker to westward flights than Blacks. Also, Blacks should have more difficulty adjusting to night-shift work and day sleep, which requires a phase delay. On the other hand, Whites should be more likely to have trouble adapting to the early work and school schedules imposed by society. More research is needed to confirm these results and predictions.},

	Abstract = {Female mammals have long been neglected in biomedical research. The NIH mandated enrollment of women in human clinical trials in 1993, but no similar initiatives exist to foster research on female animals. We reviewed sex bias in research on mammals in 10 biological fields for 2009 and their historical precedents. Male bias was evident in 8 disciplines and most prominent in neuroscience, with single-sex studies of male animals outnumbering those of females 5.5 to 1. In the past half-century, male bias in non-human studies has increased while declining in human studies. Studies of both sexes frequently fail to analyze results by sex. Underrepresentation of females in animal models of disease is also commonplace, and our understanding of female biology is compromised by these deficiencies. The majority of articles in several journals are conducted on rats and mice to the exclusion of other useful animal models. The belief that non-human female mammals are intrinsically more variable than males and too troublesome for routine inclusion in research protocols is without foundation. We recommend that when only one sex is studied, this should be indicated in article titles, and that funding agencies favor proposals that investigate both sexes and analyze data by sex.},

@article{spitschan_transparency_2020,
	Abstract = {Background:
              "Open science" is an umbrella term describing various aspects of transparent and open science practices. The adoption of practices at different levels of the scientific process (e.g., individual researchers, laboratories, institutions) has been rapidly changing the scientific research landscape in the past years, but their uptake differs from discipline to discipline. Here, we asked to what extent journals in the field of sleep research and chronobiology encourage or even require following transparent and open science principles in their author guidelines.
            
            
              Methods:
              We scored the author guidelines of a comprehensive set of 28 sleep and chronobiology journals, including the major outlets in the field, using the standardised Transparency and Openness (TOP) Factor. This instrument rates the extent to which journals encourage or require following various aspects of open science, including data citation, data transparency, analysis code transparency, materials transparency, design and analysis guidelines, study pre-registration, analysis plan pre-registration, replication, registered reports, and the use of open science badges.
            
            
              Results:
              Across the 28 journals, we find low values on the TOP Factor (median [25
              th
              , 75

              percentile] 2.5 [1, 3], min. 0, max. 9, out of a total possible score of 28) in sleep research and chronobiology journals.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our findings suggest an opportunity for sleep research and chronobiology journals to further support the recent developments in transparent and open science by implementing transparency and openness principles in their guidelines and making adherence to them mandatory.},

@article{phillips_high_2019,
	Abstract = {Before the invention of electric lighting, humans were primarily exposed to intense ({\textgreater}300 lux) or dim ({\textless}30 lux) environmental light---stimuli at extreme ends of the circadian system's dose--response curve to light. Today, humans spend hours per day exposed to intermediate light intensities (30--300 lux), particularly in the evening. Interindividual differences in sensitivity to evening light in this intensity range could therefore represent a source of vulnerability to circadian disruption by modern lighting. We characterized individual-level dose--response curves to light-induced melatonin suppression using a within-subjects protocol. Fifty-five participants (aged 18--30) were exposed to a dim control ({\textless}1 lux) and a range of experimental light levels (10--2,000 lux for 5 h) in the evening. Melatonin suppression was determined for each light level, and the effective dose for 50\% suppression (ED
              50
              ) was computed at individual and group levels. The group-level fitted ED
              50
              was 24.60 lux, indicating that the circadian system is highly sensitive to evening light at typical indoor levels. Light intensities of 10, 30, and 50 lux resulted in later apparent melatonin onsets by 22, 77, and 109 min, respectively. Individual-level ED
              50
              values ranged by over an order of magnitude (6 lux in the most sensitive individual, 350 lux in the least sensitive individual), with a 26\% coefficient of variation. These findings demonstrate that the same evening-light environment is registered by the circadian system very differently between individuals. This interindividual variability may be an important factor for determining the circadian clock's role in human health and disease.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
            Artificial lighting is omnipresent in contemporary society with disruptive consequences for human sleep and circadian rhythms because of overexposure to light, particularly in the evening/night hours. Recent evidence shows large individual variations in circadian photosensitivity, such as melatonin suppression, due to artificial light exposure. Despite the emerging body of research indicating that the effects of light on sleep and circadian rhythms vary dramatically across individuals, recommendations for appropriate light exposure in real-life settings rarely consider such individual effects. This review addresses recently identified links among individual traits, for example, age, sex, chronotype, genetic haplotypes, and the effects of evening/night light on sleep and circadian hallmarks, based on human laboratory and field studies. Target biological mechanisms for individual differences in light sensitivity include differences occurring within the retina and downstream, such as the central circadian clock. This review also highlights that there are wide gaps of uncertainty, despite the growing awareness that individual differences shape the effects of evening/night light on sleep and circadian physiology. These include (1) why do certain individual traits differentially affect the influence of light on sleep and circadian rhythms; (2) what is the translational value of individual differences in light sensitivity in populations typically exposed to light at night, such as night shift workers; and (3) what is the magnitude of individual differences in light sensitivity in population-based studies? Collectively, the current findings provide strong support for considering individual differences when defining optimal lighting specifications, thus allowing for personalized lighting solutions that promote quality of life and health.},

Current patterns of light exposure do not optimally engage these actions for many individuals, but advances in our understanding of the underpinning mechanisms and emerging lighting technologies now present opportunities to adjust lighting to promote optimal physical and mental health and performance. A newly developed, SI-compliant standard provides a way of quantifying the influence of light on the intrinsically photosensitive, melanopsin-expressing, retinal neurons that mediate these effects. The present report provides recommendations for lighting, based on an expert-scientific consensus and expressed according to this new measurement standard. These recommendations are supported by a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of human \&lsquo;non-visual\&rsquo; responses to ocular light, are centred on an easily measured quantity (melanopic equivalent daylight (D65) illuminance), and provide a straightforward framework to inform lighting design and practice.},

@article{dijk_novel_2020,
	Abstract = {The temporal organization of molecular and physiological processes is driven by environmental and behavioral cycles as well as by self-sustained molecular circadian oscillators. Quantification of phase, amplitude, period, and disruption of circadian oscillators is essential for understanding their contribution to sleep-wake disorders, social jet lag, interindividual differences in entrainment, and the development of chrono-therapeutics. Traditionally, assessment of the human circadian system, and the output of the SCN in particular, has required collection of long time series of univariate markers such as melatonin or core body temperature. Data were collected in specialized laboratory protocols designed to control for environmental and behavioral influences on rhythmicity. These protocols are time-consuming, expensive, and not practical for assessing circadian status in patients or in participants in epidemiologic studies. Novel approaches for assessment of circadian parameters of the SCN or peripheral oscillators have been developed. They are based on machine learning or mathematical model-informed analyses of features extracted from 1 or a few samples of high-dimensional data, such as transcriptomes, metabolomes, long-term simultaneous recording of activity, light exposure, skin temperature, and heart rate or in vitro approaches. Here, we review whether these approaches successfully quantify parameters of central and peripheral circadian oscillators as indexed by gold standard markers. Although several approaches perform well under entrained conditions when sleep occurs at night, the methods either perform worse in other conditions such as shift work or they have not been assessed under any conditions other than entrainment and thus we do not yet know how robust they are. Novel approaches for the assessment of circadian parameters hold promise for circadian medicine, chrono-therapeutics, and chrono-epidemiology. There remains a need to validate these approaches against gold standard markers, in individuals of all sexes and ages, in patient populations, and, in particular, under conditions in which behavioral cycles are displaced.},

@article{muthukrishna_beyond_2020,
	Abstract = {In this article, we present a tool and a method for measuring the psychological and cultural distance between societies and creating a distance scale with any population as the point of comparison. Because psychological data are dominated by samples drawn from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) nations, and overwhelmingly, the United States, we focused on distance from the United States. We also present distance from China, the country with the largest population and second largest economy, which is a common cultural comparison. We applied the fixation index ( F
              ST
              ), a meaningful statistic in evolutionary theory, to the World Values Survey of cultural beliefs and behaviors. As the extreme WEIRDness of the literature begins to dissolve, our tool will become more useful for designing, planning, and justifying a wide range of comparative psychological projects. Our code and accompanying online application allow for comparisons between any two countries. Analyses of regional diversity reveal the relative homogeneity of the United States. Cultural distance predicts various psychological outcomes.},

@article{henrich_weirdest_2010,
	Abstract = {Abstract
            
              Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers -- often implicitly -- assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these ``standard subjects'' are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species -- frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior -- hence, there are no obvious
              a priori
              grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of
              human
              nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

@article{woitowich_10-year_2020,
	Abstract = {In 2016, to address the historical overrepresentation of male subjects in biomedical research, the US National Institutes of Health implemented a policy requiring investigators to consider sex as a biological variable. In order to assess the impact of this policy, we conducted a bibliometric analysis across nine biological disciplines for papers published in 34 journals in 2019, and compared our results with those of a similar study carried out by Beery and Zucker in 2009. There was a significant increase in the proportion of studies that included both sexes across all nine disciplines, but in eight of the disciplines there was no change in the proportion studies that included data analyzed by sex. The majority of studies failed to provide rationale for single-sex studies or the lack of sex-based analyses, and those that did relied on misconceptions surrounding the hormonal variability of females. Together, these data demonstrate that while sex-inclusive research practices are more commonplace, there are still gaps in analyses and reporting of data by sex in many biological disciplines.},

@book{dignazio_data_2020,
	Abstract = {"We have seen through many examples that data science and artificial intelligence can reinforce structural inequalities like sexism and racism. Data is power, and that power is distributed unequally. This book offers a vision for a feminist data science that can challenge power and work towards justice. This book takes a stand against a world that benefits some (including the authors, two white women) at the expense of others. It seeks to provide concrete steps for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work towards justice, and for feminists seeking to learn how their own work can carry over to the growing field of data science. It is addressed to professionals in all fields where data-driven decisions are being made, as well as to communities that want to better understand the data that surrounds them. It is written for everyone who seeks to better understand the charts and statistics that they encounter in their day-to-day lives, and for everyone who seeks to better communicate the significance of such charts and statistics to others. This is an example-driven book written with a broad audience of scholars, students, and practitioners in mind. It offers a way of thinking about data, both their uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by the ideas associated with intersectional feminist thought"--},

	Abstract = {Abstract
            Sleep deficiencies, which include insufficient or long sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and irregular timing of sleep, are disproportionately distributed among populations that experience health disparities in the United States. Sleep deficiencies are associated with a wide range of suboptimal health outcomes, high-risk health behaviors, and poorer overall functioning and well-being. This report focuses on sleep health disparities (SHDs), which is a term defined as differences in one or more dimensions of sleep health on a consistent basis that adversely affect designated disadvantaged populations. SHDs appear to share many of the same determinants and causal pathways observed for health outcomes with well-known disparities. There also appears to be common behavioral and biological mechanisms that connect sleep with poorer health outcomes, suggesting a link between SHDs and other health disparities observed within these designated populations. In 2018, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research convened a workshop with experts in sleep, circadian rhythms, and health disparities to identify research gaps, challenges, and opportunities to better understand and advance research to address SHDs. The major strategy to address SHDs is to promote integration between health disparity causal pathways and sleep and circadian-related mechanisms in research approaches and study designs. Additional strategies include developing a comprehensive, integrative conceptual model, building transdisciplinary training and research infrastructure, and designing as well as testing multilevel, multifactorial interventions to address SHDs.},
